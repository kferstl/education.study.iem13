Deep learning algorithms make it possible to train multi layer neural networks. Such networks are used to recognize objects in images, to extract text and content in speach and for many other applications. Research in this area made it possible to reduce the complexity of such algorithms and to compute them in parallel on large scale run networks. Due to these optimizations, it is already possible, to produce better results with neural networks than with existing optimized mathematical algorithms for some applications. This paper focuses on the major algorithms and structures used for neural networks, the problems they come with and how they can be solved. Moreover, some applications from object recognition in images and voice analysis are examined.
